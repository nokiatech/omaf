// Wrapper class for OS read-write lock.

// Usage: When multiple threads are reading and writing using a shared resource, exclusive locks can become a
// bottleneck.
//        This occurs if the reader threads run continuously but write operations are rare.
//
// Note: There is no guarantee about the order in which threads that request ownership will be granted ownership.
