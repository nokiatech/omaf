//
// Wrapper class for OS / POSIX condition variable based manual-reset / auto-reset event.
//
// - OS event: Windows family (Win32)
// - POSIX condition variable based event: Linux family (Android, Linux), Apple family (iOS, macOS, tvOS)
//
// Manual-reset event: An event object whose state remains signaled until it is explicitly reset to
//                     non-signaled by the reset function. While it is signaled, any number of waiting threads,
//                     or threads that subsequently specify the same event object in one of the wait functions, can be
//                     released.
//
// Auto-reset event: An event object whose state remains signaled until a single waiting thread is released,
//                   at which time the system automatically sets the state to nonsignaled.
//                   If no threads are waiting, the event object's state remains signaled.
//                   If more than one thread is waiting, a waiting thread is selected.
